## Overview
Extravaganza! is a mod about adding carnival and festivity goodies, as well as some amusing activities through blocks, entities or items.

## Content

*Consider this as a summary of some of the features that are current present in the game, in version 0.1.0-beta. Some
activities that are present in the mod may be currently unfinished, and do not forget that this mod is intended to be
updated a lot in the future, as we are already gathering ideas for its future updates. Do not forget that if you have
any suggestion about content that we can add to the mod, you can submit it to
[the Extravaganza! repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/MModding/extravaganza/issues).*

### Configuration
*All recipes are shown thanks to [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei).*

Extravaganza! contains an item which is named the "Wrench Aganza" which is a kind of wrench allowing you to change some
settings of different elements of the mod. This is notably used on Merry-Go-Round and Ball Pools.

### Food

Extravaganza! provides multiple types of food, including some Candy Canes, Hot Dogs, or Popcorn.

While Candy Canes and Hot Dogs are obtained via crafting, it's a bit more complicated to obtain
Popcorn:
- You need to craft a Popcorn Machine.
- You need to craft Empty Popcorn items.
- You need to right-click on the Popcorn Machine with an Empty Popcorn item to fill it.

And it is done! You have your Popcorn.

### Activities

Extravaganza! gives you access to multiple activities. Have you ever wanted throwable balls that can bounce everywhere
in the game? Discover the Festive Balls!

These are not craftable directly, you first need to look for Common Coins, Uncommon Coins and Golden Coins that can be
obtained via exploring some mineshaft!

Then, craft a Ball Distributor, and right-click with your coins on it. It will launch respectively one, two, or four
Festive Balls depending on the rarity of the coin you have inserted to the distributor.

Another activity of Extravaganza! is the Merry Go Round. There is a big change you already experienced
this activity in real-life, especially as a child.

Anyway, the Merry Go Round present in Extravaganza! has 10 different powers, that you can
select by using the Wrench Aganza. It makes the Merry Go Round, slower, or faster.

By the way, have I already talked about Helium Balloons? Seems I didn't.

Helium Balloons are balloons which, after being placed, will fly into the sky for about ten seconds before
exploding in confetti.

There are two Helium Balloons, the Cherry Balloon and the Creeper Balloon.

Another work-in-progress activity (here be dragons - some bugs may be present) is the Ball Pool!

Ball Pools are divided into much more sub-content, that includes:

- Ball Pool Registration Table: a block that allows to set up your ball pool,
by using your Wrench Aganza to manipulate its properties such as power or covered zone.
- Ball Pool Content: blocks that you place in the pool that are made to push you the way they want
in order to make you feel like if you were not controlling your movements anymore (which can be pretty funny).
- Ball Pools are delimited zones by the covered zone you are setting through the Wrench Aganza. Though, players
can access the Ball Pool by right-clicking to the Registration Table, to get teleported at the center of the Ball Pool.
If players wants to get out of the Ball Pool, they can simply execute the `/before-entering-poll` command.

### Building Blocks

Extravaganza! provides a lot of building blocks. Most of them are variants of a "Festive Rubber" block.
So these Festive Rubber blocks, are made of... rubber, which mean you probably want to get it. But how?
You need to craft a Rubber Extractor, and then search for Hevea Brasiliensis trees in the Overworld, and
then extract the rubber from the logs that contains it. Hevea Brasiliensis Logs gets their rubber back rapidly,
since rubber is used a lot to make the festive block variants.

After having crafted festive block color variants, you are now able to put them in a Stonecutter,
to get access to... even more variants!

### Trash Cans

Yeah. Why not? I mean, after partying a lot, you need to throw all those waste into trashes, right? I hope you throw
those in trashes and not in natural places. So, anyway, Extravaganza! also provides trashes!

- The player can throw entities to trash by putting them on top of the opened trash.
- The player can throw items to trash (one by one) by sneaking + right-clicking whenever the trash is open or not.
- The player can open the trash by right-clicking.
- If the player wants to throw an entire stack, he needs to open the trash and then throw the whole stack.
